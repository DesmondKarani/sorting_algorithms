# Sorting Algorithms & Big O Notation

## Overview

This project focuses on the implementation and understanding of various sorting algorithms and the Big O notation. It is designed to deepen our knowledge of algorithm efficiency and to enhance our C programming skills, particularly in the context of sorting data.

## Objectives

- To implement at least four different sorting algorithms.
- To understand and apply Big O notation for evaluating algorithm complexity.
- To learn how to select the most appropriate sorting algorithm based on different criteria.
- To understand what a stable sorting algorithm is and identify examples.

## Environment

- **Language:** C
- **OS:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Compiler:** gcc, using flags `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- **Style guidelines:** Betty style

## Project Requirements

- Adherence to Betty coding and documentation style.
- No global variables and no more than 5 functions per file.
- Disallowed usage of standard library functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc.
- Mandatory inclusion of a `README.md` file.
- Header files should be include guarded.
- GitHub for version controlling and collaboration.

## Project Structure

This project contains the following files and directories:

- **sort.h**: Header file containing all function prototypes and the data structure for the doubly linked list.
- **print_array.c**: Contains the `print_array` function used to print an array of integers.
- **print_list.c**: Contains the `print_list` function used to print a list of integers.
- **[algorithm_name].c**: Implementation files for each sorting algorithm.
- **README.md**: This file, explaining the project and its structure.

## Implemented Algorithms

1. **Algorithm 1**: Brief description
2. **Algorithm 2**: Brief description
3. **Algorithm 3**: Brief description
4. **Algorithm 4**: Brief description

## Usage

Instructions on how to compile and run the project, including any relevant examples.

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o [output_name]
./[output_name]
```

## Collaboration

While this project is just my effort, I had assistance from several of my peers along the process.
